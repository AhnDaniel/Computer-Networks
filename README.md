# Computer-Networks
Implemented a basic socket-programming project employing TCP/UDP connection between client and server
Utilized computer network architecture concepts to replicate a file transfer protocol on a local network

In this program, I created a simplified version of the framing or packet structure of sent packets by creating a buffer of a defined length and writing into the buffer and sending it from the server to the client locally on my computer. It also utilizes the concepts of verification vs non-verification between TCP connections and UDP connections respectively.
